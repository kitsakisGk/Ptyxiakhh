**Abstract**

  The recognition of human activity is an important problem in the field of pattern recognition.
Successfully solving this problem can help improve the quality of people's lives, such as enhancing
healthcare and the independence of the elderly.  
  The Sussex Locomotion Dataset is a collection of motion recordings from sensors on portable
devices. The provided data includes motion records. This thesis aims to develop a method that
allows the recognition of activities from the Sussex Locomotion Dataset. Specifically, the goal is
to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the user's activity every 30 seconds.  
  It will be based on machine learning algorithms and will leverage the data provided by
the Sussex Locomotion Dataset. The research findings can be helpful in various fields, such as
healthcare, security, and education.
